# Overview

I attemmpted to implement Spotify's API via JavaScript. Most projects using this system are programmed using python or javascript. I have been making a few websites of recent though so I decided to attempt to implement some functions on a website. My original idea was to submit inputs that would increase or decrease certain recommendations based off music traits. This code was supposed to create a customized playlist with customized preferences.

I love music and sometimes I don't always love spotify's recommendations. I wanted to see how it worked and if I could customize them for myself.
